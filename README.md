# Java Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game that have created with Java. I used Javax Swing to give it a frame and buttons. 

This game is for 2 players. One player uses X and the other uses O. The players take turns placing their marks on a grid of 3-by-3 cells. 

If a player gets 3 marks in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally, then that player wins the game.
